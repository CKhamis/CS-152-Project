# Workout Buddy v.1.0
An application written in Java Swing that displays workouts, created playlists, and allows you to create custom playlists. Workouts are hard coded into the Starter file, but program is full extendable if more workouts needed to be added. This project may be one of the very last Java Swing applications I make, as alternatives are far better.
## View Workouts
The main tab of the application shows you the available workouts to try. Click on one to see details.

## Create Workout Playlists
This tab will allow you to add an infinite amount of workouts to a playlist. You can name playlists whatever you want in the top left and save it on the top right.
